# CTMUN Parley
### A simple, web based solution to chairing a room

Parley is a javascript webapp using styling from [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) and autocomplete from [Typeahead](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/). This version of Parley was adapted from the application originally built by Joshua Singer for the MUNSA conference. Feel free to use this in other conferences, as long as attribution is given.
